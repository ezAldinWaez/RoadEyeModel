    "Thresholding is an image processing technique used to separate features of interest from the background in an image. it involves setting a threshold value, which acts as a boundary to determine whether a pixel's intensity or color value is considered part of the object or background. we aim to use Thresholds to enhance the quality of images before performing object detection which prepares images for better object detection and classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once objects are segmented using thresholding, various algorithms can be applied to detect and recognize objects based on their shape, size, texture, or other visual features.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of Thresholding in the context of Image Processing, where we will use the most famous types (THRESH_BINARY, THRESH_OTSU, ADAPTIVE_THRESH where the last type can apply with two ways: thresh_arithmetic_mean and thresh_gaussian_mean)"
