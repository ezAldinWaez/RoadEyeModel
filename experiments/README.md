# RoadEye Experiments

As any computer vision project, image processing is an essential part of RoadEye.

We want to make vehicle detection easier, more efficent, and more accuret, to do so, we're trying, in those experiments, to apply manipulation, enhancement, restoration, and segmentation techniques on dataset frames.

## Milestones

- Make the frames more simpler by removing unimportant items (e.g. convert it to grayscale or binary, down-scale it, etc.)
- Extract some features from the frame (e.g. edges, contores, etc.)
-
