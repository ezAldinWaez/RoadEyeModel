    "\n",
    "- Speed Processing Optimization: Resizing contour images can help us to faster processing times, as operations performed on smaller images typically require less computational effort, this also help Algorithms such as contour detection, feature extraction, and object recognition to run more efficiently on resized images, this resulting in shorter processing times.\n",
